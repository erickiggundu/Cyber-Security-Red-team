Link:(ssh asteria@hades.hackmyvm.eu -p 6666) 
note this accepting the ssh port config or link so we passed through asteria to access this level.
User:
astraea
Method of solve:
We are logged out of login when we use astraea creditenials
if we look at the /etc/ssh/sshd_config using another account, we see that astraea doesn't have a standard SSH shell
Turns out there is a busybox binary on this server, and we can use that to enumerate(search) other open ports on the localhost
There's an FTP server running on localhost, so we use astraea's credentials on localhost FTP, but first we have to move
into a public writable directory
commands:
cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config
find / -name *busybox* 2>/dev/null
/var/tmp/busybox netstat -tulpn
mkdir
ftp localhost
cd /pwned/astraea
ls -la
get atalanta.txt
get mission.txt
