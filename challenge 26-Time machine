#Challenge description

You look like someone who is interested in backstories! There are a few exciting aspects to Hack The Web's origin story, and here's a little history lesson just for you.
The concept of challenges arranged in a map has been adopted by Hack The Web from Hacker.org. This site is a great inspiration, but it didn't fall from the sky either. When the Challenges were published in 2008, a project that could be described as a hacker community had been on the domain for many years.
Thanks to the Internet Archive, we can travel back in time, and you can experience how this community got along.
Here you can see a version of hacker.org from the December 18, 1996. 
Your answer is any one of the misspelled words in the greeting text.
