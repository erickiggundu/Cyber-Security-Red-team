#Challenge Description:
Just like you can redirect output from programs, you can redirect input to programs! This is done using <, as so:
hacker@dojo:~$ echo yo > message
hacker@dojo:~$ cat message
yo
hacker@dojo:~$ rev < message
oy
You can do interesting things with a lot of different programs using input redirection! In this level, we will practice using /challenge/run,
which will require you to redirect the PWN file to it and have the PWN file contain the value COLLEGE! To write that value to the PWN file, 
recall the prior challenge on output redirection from echo!

#Method of Solving:
You have to first redirect the echo COLLEGE  > PWN the read it with cat and later you out direct to /challenge/run < PWN
then you capture the flag
