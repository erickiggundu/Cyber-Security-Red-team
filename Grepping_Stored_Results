#Challenge Description:
You know how to run commands, how to redirect their output (e.g., >), and how to search through the resulting file (e.g., grep). Let's put this together!
In preparation for more complex levels, we want you to:
    Redirect the output of /challenge/run to /tmp/data.txt.
    This will result in a hundred thousand lines of text, with one of them being the flag, in /tmp/data.txt.
    grep that for the flag!

#Method of Solving:
So i redirected the /challenge/run > /tmp/data.txt. and then used the grep command to grep "pwn.college" /tmp/data.txt and the captured the flag 
#Flag:
pwn.college{89BoQRccCpDjEY7xydWzcSDP9LI.QX4EDO0wSM0cDMzEzW
