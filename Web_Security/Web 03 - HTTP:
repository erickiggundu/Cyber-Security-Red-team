# Challenge Description 
When an HTTP request is sent, in addition to the verb, the path to the desired resource, and any associated parameters, some additional information is communicated to the server in fields called headers (derived from the fact that they are sent in the first part of the HTTP message). Similarly,
the server will also attach headers to the response in addition to the requested content.
These headers differ from the GET request parameters because they are not used to specify the requested resource, but contain information about the client (called user-agent ), 
the server, and the communication channel, metadata associated with the resources, and any debugging information.

These headers are generally inserted automatically by the client and server libraries and belong to a standard set defined as part of the protocol itself; however, 
additional headers can be specified to meet the needs of particular applications. These non-standard headers typically have names starting with , 
X-and when sent to a system that cannot recognize them, they are usually ignored.

In this challenge, a non-standard header was used to provide a homemade authentication mechanism.
The goal is to retrieve the text of the resource at address http://web-03.challs.olicyber.it/flag, 
but the server will only respond to requests that contain the header X-Passwordcontaining the correct password, admin.

It is recommended to use the headers keyword of the function getused in previous challenges.
Note: The HTTP protocol already provides several authentication mechanisms via the standard header Authorization,
which are generally more complex than the "homemade" authentication example presented in this challenge. Rather than directly manipulating the header ,
libraries such as provide specific methodsAuthorization to interface with it when necessary .requests

#Method of Solve
*The method i have use is that i have first download the challenge.py file and then executed, After excuting it it read it is content using nano GUI,
*After i wrote new file named clients.py then opened it with nano, after i wrote snippet code in cpython
*Make the GET request with the custom header,Print the response (this will be the flag if authentication succeeds)
and Print the status code to verify success

'''''
import requests

url = "http://web-03.challs.olicyber.it/flag"
headers = {"X-Password": "admin"}
response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
print(response.text)
