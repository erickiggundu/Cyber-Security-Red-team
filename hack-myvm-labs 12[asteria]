Mission contents
The user astrea believes in magic
There's a sihiri_old.php file in the home directory in level content next mission.txt
These contents follows;
(cat sihiri_old.php ) when cat and read the file sihiri_old.php it will give that code snippet

<?php
$pass = hash('md5', $_GET['pass']);
$pass2 = hash('md5',"ASTRAEA_PASS");
if($pass == $pass2){
print("ASTRAEA_PASS");
}
else{
print("Incorrect ^^");
}
?>

The funny way that PHP handles datatypes, also known as the type juggling vulnerability, when applied to hash comparisons, this can result in magic hashes that match any md5 hash.
