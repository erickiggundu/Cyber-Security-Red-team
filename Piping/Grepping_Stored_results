#Concept
Redirecting and grepping results


#Challenge Description
You know how to run commands, how to redirect their output (e.g., >), and how to search through the resulting file (e.g., grep). Let's put this together!

In preparation for more complex levels, we want you to:

Redirect the output of /challenge/run to /tmp/data.txt.
This will result in a hundred thousand lines of text, with one of them being the flag, in /tmp/data.txt.
grep that for the flag!

Method of Solve 
you redirect the /challenge/run > /tmp/data.txt and after grep the flag using grep command and make it grep "pwn.college /tmp/data.txt." boom flag

#Flag:
pwn.college{89BoQRccCpDjEY7xydWzcSDP9LI.QX4EDO0wSM0cDMzEzW}
