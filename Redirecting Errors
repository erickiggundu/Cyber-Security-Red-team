#Challenge Description
Just like standard output, you can also redirect the error channel of commands. Here, we'll learn about File Descriptor numbers. 
A File Descriptor (FD) is a number that describes a communication channel in Linux. You've already been using them, even though you didn't realize it. 
We're already familiar with three:

    FD 0: Standard Input
    FD 1: Standard Output
    FD 2: Standard Error
When you redirect process communication, you do it by FD number, though some FD numbers are implicit. For example, a > without a number implies 1>, 
which redirects FD 1 (Standard Output). Thus, the following two commands are equivalent:
hacker@dojo:~$ echo hi > asdf
hacker@dojo:~$ echo hi 1> asdf
Redirecting errors is pretty easy from this point. If you have a command that might produce data via standard error (such as /challenge/run), you can do:
hacker@dojo:~$ /challenge/run 2> errors.log
That will redirect standard error (FD 2) to the errors.log file. Furthermore, you can redirect multiple file descriptors at the same time! For example:
hacker@dojo:~$ some_command > output.log 2> errors.log
That command will redirect output to output.log and errors to errors.log.
Let's put this into practice! In this challenge, you will need to redirect the output of /challenge/run, like before, to myflag, and the "errors" 
(in our case, the instructions) to instructions. You'll notice that nothing will be printed to the terminal, because you have redirected everything! 
You can find the instructions/feedback in instructions and the flag in myflag when you successfully pull this off!

#Method of Solving:
Run /challenge/run
Redirect its normal output (stdout) into a file called myflag
Redirect its error output (stderr) into a file called instructions
